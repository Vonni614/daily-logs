So yesterday i did some pair programming with Connor, where we discussed some new ways to improve our projects, and i`ve spent some time on my project and after that i`ve been reading and watching about mysql databases 
and how they can be used in web development. 

my plan for today is to continue working on databases and maybe to we will tr use it in the projects,
because all my application details are stored in local storage.
