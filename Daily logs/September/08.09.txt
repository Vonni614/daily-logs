So yesterday i`ve spent most of the day finishing my project in python, especially 
setting up UI for the programme.

My plan for today is to pay attention to all my reflections and documentations. As well I would 
spend some time practicing my skills on CodeWars.

I had only one blocker yesterday, which was logical issue with my code, that i wasn`t able 
to fix for several hours. Everything is sorted for now
