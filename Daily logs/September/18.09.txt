So on friday i`ve spent my day learning java and css and practising some 
new features in visual studio. 

My plan for today is try to set up my plan for pair programming and continue 
learning html and css with java, cause i found out that is really interesting for me. 

The only blocker for me, i haven`t oraganised anything about pair programming for that week, i mean i don`t know how to sort it out yet, so probably i`ll do it through slack as well
