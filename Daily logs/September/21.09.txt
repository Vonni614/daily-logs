Yesterday i`ve made my notes for my personal development plan, 
watched some java tutorials and tried to remake all the code using java 
instead of python. 

My plan for today is to finally finish project
and maybe add some new features to it as well.And to make some notes and comments of what i`ve done and what i`ve learned so far.


no blockers today
