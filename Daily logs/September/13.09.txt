SO yesterday I`ve been mostly watching and reading tutorials about
HTML, CSS and JAvaScript and how to use them to create a web apllication.
As well, I had a look of what I can do as part of my project, and created 
task list of what do i need to learn to be able to do it.

My plan for today is to visit guest lecture and start working on my web application 
and read more about using python in web development. And practise my python skills 
using CodeWars. But most of the day will be dedicated to my projected. 

No blockers so far.
