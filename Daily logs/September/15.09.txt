yesterday i have finally written down all my reflections for the week 1, 
and started writing them for that week too. As well, i`ve spend some time 
watching java and python tutorials and how to use them with html and css.

my plan for today is continue getting more information about using java for the web applications, 
and continue working on my project trying to use everything new that i`ve learned
so far.  


And blocker for me was that i wanted to study everything at the same time, that was no the best thing to do, and i need to focus on something specific for now
