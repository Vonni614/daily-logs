So basically yesterday i have spent most of the day trying to get more knowledge about user interfaces in python to fit it into my project,
.So i`ve been reading libraries documentation and tried to adjust it into 
my programme through trail and error. 

My plan for today is to finish my Graphic Interface completely and try to add some new features, and after that i will have a look at agile badge. 

No blockers now for me so far
