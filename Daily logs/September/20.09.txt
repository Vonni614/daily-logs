So basically yesterday i wasn`t able to do much practising, but i`ve watched a lot of tutorials and
had a look how the basic wed applications are made, and what tools people are using for them. 

Today, I'm planning to work on my Personal Development Plan, attend guest lecture as well,  and keep practicing what I've learned. I will continue working on my project. 
I'm also going to give Java a shot instead of Python  
cause java seems like it might be a better fit for the project rather than python.
