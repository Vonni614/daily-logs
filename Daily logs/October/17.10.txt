Yesterday, I had a look at React.js and pushed some notes to my repository. Now, I'm working on setting up my portfolio with what I have so far, aiming to finish it by Friday.

Today's plan involves to improve my reflection notes and adding some new code work to my repository that I've done recently. And of course, continuing to practice React and working on team project. 


I don't have any blockers at the moment.
