"So in the last couple of days I did manage to do some reflections stuff and had a look at my project that i want to improve, and I spent some time catching up on all the things that I missed."

"The plan for today is to finish everything that I wasn`t able to do during the last week, and maybe spend some time practicing Java as well."

"The only blocker for me so fat was that I wasn't able to do much last week because I wasn't feeling good."
